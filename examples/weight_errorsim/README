Projects:
--------------------
analyse: ( Need to be refactored ) 
1. algorithm to compute response time and accuracy
2. pilots program that generates correct error signatures based on real weight instead of predicted weight.

bayesian: ( Future development: using bayesian directly to compute the error signatures )
Uses Dynamic Bayes algorithm to compute Coefficient of Lift

with_cruise_detection:
Uses cruise detection algorithm and linear model to compute error signatures and estimated weights.

without_cruise_detection:
Uses linear model to compute error signatures and estimated weights.

Files:
--------------------
Handler: outputHandler for estimated and measured weights. 
Handler_mode: outputHandler for current signature.
producer_error: dataProducer generating measured weight data with errors.
producer_real:  dataProducer generating measured weight data without errors.
